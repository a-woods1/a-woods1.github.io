            For people with visual impairments we have designed and structured the app so it can be read with a screen reader and included alternate content for any featured images.  <br/><br/>

            We've also considered other elements of web accessibility, using the IBM heuristics listed <a href="https://usabilitynews.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/45729" target="_blank"> here</a>, including ensuring appropriate color contrast and not relying solely on color as an indicator within the design.<br/>
